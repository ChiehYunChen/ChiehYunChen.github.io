I am an AI researcher, cooking interesting ideas. 
<br> Feel free to contact me (<cychenisme@gmail.com>). I am open for cooperation!

I received the MS from the Institute of Electronics at National (Yang Ming) Chiao Tung University in 2021, advised by [Prof. Wen-Huang Cheng](http://aimmlab.nctu.edu.tw/whcheng/index.html) and [Prof. Hong-Han Shuai](https://basiclab.lab.nycu.edu.tw/) and BS from the Department of Electrophysics at National Chiao Tung University in 2020. 

My research interests include multimedia and computer vision. My research recently focuses on 2D image-based and video-based multi-pose virtual try-on, and receives 1<sup>st</sup> Place Award in the 2020 CVPR LIP Challenge (Track: Multi-pose Virtual Try-on Challenge). 

My works have appeared in top-tier conferences and journals such as CVPR, ICCV, ACMMM, TNNLS, and ACM CSUR. I've served as the invited reviewer for IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TMM, IEEE TCSVT, and ACM TOMM.
